= PCF Roadshow CD Lab - HKG


== Intro

This lab will guide you through building a "BASIC" continuous delivery pipeline using Jenkins, Artifactory, and Cloud
Foundry.

== Setup Steps

. FORK (using the GitHub UI) and clone the [citytest repo](https://github.com/cqueiroz-pivotal/citytest):
+
[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GIT_USERNAME>/citytest
$ cd citytest
----

Login to your Jenkins instance at CloudBees. (if using Cloud Jenkins).

Navigate to Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins > Available.

Install the following plugins:

Gradle

Mask Passwords

Extensible Choice Parameter Plugin

Artifactory Plugin

Parameterized Trigger Plugin

When you do, tell Jenkins to restart after plugin install.


. Login to your Aritfactory Online instance.

. Navigate to +Admin > Security > General+.

. Activate encryption for passwords.

. Next navigate to +Admin > Security > Users+.

. Create a new user named +deployer+ with a password of your choosing.

. Once created, navigate to +Admin > Security > Permissions+.

. +Edit+ the +Anything+ permissions target.

. Select the +Users+ tab, and check all permissions for your new user.

. Logout, and then log back in as your new user.

. Click on the account name in the top right hand corner of the screen.

. Enter your password and click +Unlock+.

. Copy your encrypted password and paste it somewhere safe.

. Next, send your artifactory details to the CF Jenkins admin (Carlos Queiroz).
+
URL:: `https://<<your artifactory hostname>>.artifactoryonline.com/<<your artifactory hostname>>` (e.g.
+https://cqueiroz.artifactoryonline.com/cqueiroz+)
Username:: the user you created in artifactory
Password:: the encrypted password you copied a moment ago

== Create the Initial Build Job

. Navigate back to Jenkins Home (http://pivotal-cloudbees.apj.fe.pivotal.io).

. Login with your PCF account.

. Click +New Job+, give it the name +citytest-uniquetoken+ and select ``Build a free-style software project.'' Then
click +OK+. Replace in the script below +uniquetoken+ with something like your username!

. Under +Source Code Management+, select +Git+, and supply your repository URL (e.g. `https://github.com/<YOUR_GIT_USERNAME>/citytest`).

. Under +Build Triggers+, select +Poll SCM+ and provide the string +* * * * *+.

. Under +Build Environment+, select +Gradle-Artifactory Integration+.
+
* Select your Artifactory server.
* Select +libs-releases_local+ as the +Publishing Repository+.
* Ensure the following are checked:
** Capture and publish build info
** Allow promotion of non-staged builds
** Publish artifacts to Artifactory
** Publish Ivy descriptors

. Under +Build+, add a +Invoke Gradle Script+ build step.
+
Gradle Version:: gradle-latest
Build Step Description:: +build environment agnostic artifact+
Switches:: +-Pbuildversion=$BUILD_NUMBER+
Tasks:: +clean assemble+

. Save the config and try running the build by clicking ``Build Now''. Ensure that you see the artifact in Artifactory.

== Create the Deploy Job

. Navigate back to Jenkins Home (http://pivotal-cloudbees.apj.fe.pivotal.io).

. Login with your PCF account.

. Click +New Job+, give it the name +citytest-uniquetoken-deploy+ and select ``Build a free-style software project.''
 Then click +OK+.

. Check +This build is parameterized+.

. Click +Add Parameter+ and choose +Extensible Choice+. Make sure to click on the arrow pointing down to allow
multiple lines
+
Name:: +BUILD_VERSION+
Description:: +The citytest build to promote.+
Choice Provider:: +System Groovy Choice Parameter+
Groovy System Script::
+
[source,groovy]
----
import jenkins.model.*
import hudson.model.*

def getAllBuildNumbers(Job job) {
  def buildNumbers = []
  (job.getBuilds()).each { build ->
    buildNumbers.add(build.getDisplayName().substring(1))
  }
  return buildNumbers
}

def buildJob = Jenkins.instance.getItemByFullName('citytest-uniquetoken');
return getAllBuildNumbers(buildJob)
----

. Under +Build Environment+, select +Generic-Artifactory Integration+.
* Select your Artifactory server.
* Select +ext-releases_local+ as the +Target Repository+.
+
Resolved Artifacts:: `libs-releases-local:citytest-uniquetoken/${BUILD_VERSION}/*=>artifacts`
+
* Ensure +Capture and Publish Build Info+ is checked.

. Check +Mask Passwords+, then Add:
+
Name:: +CF_PASSWORD+
Password:: Your Pivotal Web Services Password

. Under +Build+, add a +Execute Shell+ build step. Remember to replace in the script below +uniquetoken+ with something
like your username!
+
Command::
+
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
PIVOTAL_WEB_SERVICE_USERNAME="<<<YOUR PWS Username >>>"
PIVOTAL_WEB_SERVICE_ORGANIZATION="<<<YOUR PWS Organization>>>"
PIVOTAL_WEB_SERVICE_SPACE="<<<YOUR PWS Space>>>"

echo "Deployed Version: $DEPLOYED_VERSION"
echo "Route Version: $ROUTE_VERSION"

echo "Is artifacts/citytest-${BUILD_VERSION}.jar exists?"
pwd
ls -l artifacts/citytest-${BUILD_VERSION}.jar

cf map-route "cities-${YOUR_UNIQUE_TOKEN}-${BUILD_VERSION}" cfapps.io -n cities-${YOUR_UNIQUE_TOKEN}
cf scale cities-${YOUR_UNIQUE_TOKEN}-${BUILD_VERSION} -i 2
if [ ! -z "$DEPLOYED_VERSION" -a "$DEPLOYED_VERSION" != " " -a "$DEPLOYED_VERSION" != "cities-${YOUR_UNIQUE_TOKEN}-${BUILD_VERSION}" ]; then
  echo "Performing zero-downtime cutover to $BUILD_VERSION"
  while read line
  do
    if [ ! -z "$line" -a "$line" != " " -a "$line" != "cities-${YOUR_UNIQUE_TOKEN}-${BUILD_VERSION}" ]; then
      echo "Scaling down, unmapping and removing $line"
      cf scale "$line" -i 1
      cf unmap-route "$line" cfapps.io -n cities-${YOUR_UNIQUE_TOKEN}
      cf delete "$line" -f
    else
      echo "Skipping $line"
    fi
  done <<< "$DEPLOYED_VERSION"
fi
----

. Save the config and try running the build by clicking ``Build With Parameters''. Select the build you created in the previous step from the drop list. You should see the build deploy to Cloud Foundry.

== Create the Trigger

. Return to the +citytest-unitoken+ project and click +Configure+.

. Under +Post Build Actions+ add a post-build action, selecting +Trigger parameterized build on other projects+.
+
Projects to build:: +citytest-unitoken-deploy+
Predefined parameters:: +BUILD_VERSION=$BUILD_NUMBER+

. Save the config and try running the build by clicking ``Build Now''. You should see both builds executed coupled with a zero-downtime deploy of the app to Cloud Foundry.

== Make a Commit and Watch the Pipeline Run

. In your local clone of the +citytest+ project, open +src/main/java/org/example/cities/VersionController.java+ in an
editor.

. Change the version number in the string.

. Execute +git commit -am "change version number"+.

. Execute +git push origin master+.

. You should see both builds executed coupled with a zero-downtime deploy of the app to Cloud Foundry!

. Congrats! You've reached the end of the lab.
